I had added it up
I had made all my plans
But the road I had paved turned into dust
And I just didn't understand
I prayed for You to show up
I laid my weapons down
Surrendered to Your Love
And looking back now, oh
Every closed door, every single sharp thorn
Every answer that didn't make sense
What if maybe
They were just teaching me to depend on
Your strength in the dark days
All my tears got me crying out to You again
What if maybe
Every broken place I've been
Was a godsend
A godsend
It was a godsend
 
I remember being convinced
There'd never been a winter so cold
Turns out spring was around the corner
You were turning it into gold
And when I couldn't feel You
And it was hard to breathe in
I realized I need You
Now I see the beauty in
Every closed door, every single sharp thorn
Every answer that didn't make sense
What if maybe
They were just teaching me to depend on
Your strength in the dark days
All my tears got me crying out to You again
What if maybe
Every broken place I've been
Was a godsend
A godsend
It was a godsend
 
God send
More mountains that I need Your help to move
God send
Me through the storm
If it gets me back to You
God send
Daylight to lead me when I don't know what to do
God send
Me to my knees
Just to bring me close to You
Every closed door, every single sharp thorn
Every answer that didn't make sense
What if maybe
They were just teaching me to depend on
Your strength in the dark days
All my tears got me crying out to You again
What if maybe
Every broken place I've been
Was a godsend
A godsend
Even if I didn't know it then?
Godsend
 
Godsend
Even though I didn't know it then?
